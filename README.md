A flexible markdown processor for writers and bloggers. (Proper description
is pending.)

## Relation to Common Mark

MMark implements Common Mark specification
as [given here](https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark). We have a test suite
called `common-mark-spec` that runs examples from the spec and ensures that
MMark produces correct results.

The `common-mark-spec.json` file has been obtained from the original spec by
running:

```
$ python test/spec_tests.py --dump-tests > common-mark-spec.json
```

We'll try to keep the spec in this repo up to date.
